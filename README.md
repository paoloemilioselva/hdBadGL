BadGL
-----

The name of this delegate says it all: don't use it as example for a proper GL renderer.

This is a Pixar's Hydra Delegate small test mostly for education purposes and to write stats on screen in Solaris.

The cmake config has 2 targets you can pick from: using just OpenUSD or using SideFX's HUSD (requires Houdini/Solaris to be installed).

Any comment or feedback is more than welcome.
